There was a place,\r\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\r\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\r\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\r\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\r\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\r\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\r\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\r\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\r\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\r\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\r\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\r\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\r\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\r\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\r", "O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\r\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n  For what God after better worse would build?\r\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\r\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\r\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\r\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\r\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\r\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\r\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\r\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\r\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\r\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\r\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\r\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\r\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\r\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\r\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\r\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\r\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\r\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\r\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\r\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\r\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\r\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\r\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\r\n  Exalted from so base original,\r\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\r\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\r\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\r\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\r\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\r\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\r\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\r\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r", "So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\r\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\r\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\r\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\r\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\r\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\r\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\r", "ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\r\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\r\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\r\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\n  For while so near each other thus all day\r\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\r", "O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\r\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\r\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\r\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\r\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\r\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\r\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\r\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\r\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\r\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\r\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\n  May have diverted from continual watch\r\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\r\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\r\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\r\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\r\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\r\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\r\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\r\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\r\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\r", "So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\r\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\r\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\r\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\r\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\r\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\r\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\r\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r", "Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\r\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\r\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\r\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\r\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\r\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\r\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\r\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\r\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\r\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\r\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r", "Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\r\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\r\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\r\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\r\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\r"], "persistenceData": [{"dim": 0, "death": 1, "gen": 0, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 1, "gen": 1, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 5, "gen": 2, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 10, "gen": 3, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 20, "gen": 4, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 37, "gen": 5, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": 76, "gen": 6, "birth": 0}, {"dim": 0, "death": -1, "gen": 7, "birth": 0}], "matrix": [{"pair": [0, 1], "dist": 2653}, {"pair": [0, 2], "dist": 1696}, {"pair": [0, 3], "dist": 1751}, {"pair": [0, 4], "dist": 1674}, {"pair": [0, 5], "dist": 1746}, {"pair": [0, 6], "dist": 1664}, {"pair": [0, 7], "dist": 1962}, {"pair": [1, 2], "dist": 2881}, {"pair": [1, 3], "dist": 2993}, {"pair": [1, 4], "dist": 2730}, {"pair": [1, 5], "dist": 2969}, {"pair": [1, 6], "dist": 2831}, {"pair": [1, 7], "dist": 3272}, {"pair": [2, 3], "dist": 875}, {"pair": [2, 4], "dist": 1249}, {"pair": [2, 5], "dist": 864}, {"pair": [2, 6], "dist": 1001}, {"pair": [2, 7], "dist": 942}, {"pair": [3, 4], "dist": 1256}, {"pair": [3, 5], "dist": 764}, {"pair": [3, 6], "dist": 974}, {"pair": [3, 7], "dist": 739}, {"pair": [4, 5], "dist": 1245}, {"pair": [4, 6], "dist": 1235}, {"pair": [4, 7], "dist": 1405}, {"pair": [5, 6], "dist": 966}, {"pair": [5, 7], "dist": 749}, {"pair": [6, 7], "dist": 1063}]}
