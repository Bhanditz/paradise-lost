Why is life giv'n\r\n  To be thus wrested from us? rather why\r\n  Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew\r\n  What we receive, would either not accept\r\n  Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,\r\n  Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus\r\n  Th' Image of God in man created once\r\n  So goodly and erect, though faultie since,\r\n  To such unsightly sufferings be debas't\r\n  Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,\r\n  Retaining still Divine similitude\r\n  In part, from such deformities be free,\r\n  And for his Makers Image sake exempt?\r", "O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\r\n  That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\r\n  Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\r\n  Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;\r\n  And put to proof his high Supremacy,\r\n  Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\r\n  Too well I see and rue the dire event,\r\n  That with sad overthrow and foul defeat\r\n  Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host\r\n  In horrible destruction laid thus low,\r\n  As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences\r\n  Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\r\n  Invincible, and vigour soon returns,\r\n  Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state\r\n  Here swallow'd up in endless misery.\r\n  But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\r\n  Of force believe Almighty, since no less\r\n  Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)\r\n  Have left us this our spirit and strength intire\r\n  Strongly to suffer and support our pains,\r\n  That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\r\n  Or do him mightier service as his thralls\r\n  By right of Warr, what e're his business be\r\n  Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\r\n  Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\r\n  What can it then avail though yet we feel\r\n  Strength undiminisht, or eternal being\r\n  To undergo eternal punishment?\r\n  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.\r", "He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\r\n  Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\r\n  The sound of blustring winds, which all night long\r\n  Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\r\n  Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\r\n  Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\r\n  After the Tempest: Such applause was heard\r\n  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,\r\n  Advising peace: for such another Field\r\n  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\r\n  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL\r\n  Wrought still within them; and no less desire\r\n  To found this nether Empire, which might rise\r\n  By pollicy, and long process of time,\r\n  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.\r\n  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,\r\n  SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave\r\n  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd\r\n  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and publick care;\r\n  And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\r\n  Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood\r\n  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear\r\n  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\r\n  Drew audience and attention still as Night\r\n  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\r", "So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;\r\n  For neither Man nor Angel can discern\r\n  Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks\r\n  Invisible, except to God alone,\r\n  By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth:\r\n  And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps\r\n  At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie\r\n  Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill\r\n  Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd\r\n  URIEL, though Regent of the Sun, and held\r\n  The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n;\r\n  Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule\r\n  In his uprightness answer thus returnd.\r\n  Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know\r\n  The works of God, thereby to glorifie\r\n  The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess\r\n  That reaches blame, but rather merits praise\r\n  The more it seems excess, that led thee hither\r\n  From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,\r\n  To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps\r\n  Contented with report heare onely in heav'n:\r\n  For wonderful indeed are all his works,\r\n  Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all\r\n  Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;\r\n  But what created mind can comprehend\r\n  Thir number, or the wisdom infinite\r\n  That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.\r\n  I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,\r\n  This worlds material mould, came to a heap:\r\n  Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar\r\n  Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd;\r\n  Till at his second bidding darkness fled,\r\n  Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:\r\n  Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then\r\n  The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,\r\n  And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n\r\n  Flew upward, spirited with various forms,\r\n  That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs\r\n  Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;\r\n  Each had his place appointed, each his course,\r\n  The rest in circuit walles this Universe.\r\n  Look downward on that Globe whose hither side\r\n  With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;\r\n  That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light\r\n  His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere\r\n  Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon\r\n  (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide\r\n  Timely interposes, and her monthly round\r\n  Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n;\r\n  With borrowd light her countenance triform\r\n  Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,\r\n  And in her pale dominion checks the night.\r\n  That spot to which I point is PARADISE,\r\n  ADAMS abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.\r\n  Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.\r", "To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:\r\n  URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight,\r\n  Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,\r\n  See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass\r\n  The vigilance here plac't, but such as come\r\n  Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour\r\n  No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,\r\n  So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds\r\n  On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude\r\n  Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.\r\n  But if within the circuit of these walks\r\n  In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom\r\n  Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.\r", "Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,\r\n  If these magnific Titles yet remain\r\n  Not meerly titular, since by Decree\r\n  Another now hath to himself ingross't\r\n  All Power, and us eclipst under the name\r\n  Of King anointed, for whom all this haste\r\n  Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,\r\n  This onely to consult how we may best\r\n  With what may be devis'd of honours new\r\n  Receive him coming to receive from us\r\n  Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,\r\n  Too much to one, but double how endur'd,\r\n  To one and to his image now proclaim'd?\r\n  But what if better counsels might erect\r\n  Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?\r\n  Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend\r\n  The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust\r\n  To know ye right, or if ye know your selves\r\n  Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before\r\n  By none, and if not equal all, yet free,\r\n  Equally free; for Orders and Degrees\r\n  Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.\r\n  Who can in reason then or right assume\r\n  Monarchie over such as live by right\r\n  His equals, if in power and splendor less,\r\n  In freedome equal? or can introduce\r\n  Law and Edict on us, who without law\r\n  Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,\r\n  And look for adoration to th' abuse\r\n  Of those Imperial Titles which assert\r\n  Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve?\r", "So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd\r\n  His count'nance too severe to be beheld\r\n  And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.\r\n  At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings\r\n  With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes\r\n  Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound\r\n  Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.\r\n  Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,\r\n  Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles\r\n  The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,\r\n  All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon\r\n  Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand\r\n  Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent\r\n  Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd\r\n  Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,\r\n  All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;\r\n  O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode\r\n  Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\r\n  That wish'd the Mountains now might be again\r\n  Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.\r\n  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell\r\n  His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,\r\n  Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,\r\n  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,\r\n  One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye\r\n  Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\r\n  Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,\r\n  And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,\r\n  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.\r\n  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd\r\n  His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant\r\n  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:\r\n  The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard\r\n  Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd\r\n  Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd\r\n  With terrors and with furies to the bounds\r\n  And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,\r\n  Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd\r\n  Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight\r\n  Strook them with horror backward, but far worse\r\n  Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw\r\n  Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth\r\n  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.\r", "So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,\r\n  With HALLELUIAHS: Thus was Sabbath kept.\r\n  And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd\r\n  How first this World and face of things began,\r\n  And what before thy memorie was don\r\n  From the beginning, that posteritie\r\n  Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst\r\n  Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.\r", "To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd.\r\n  Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond\r\n  Compare above all living Creatures deare,\r\n  Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd\r\n  How we might best fulfill the work which here\r\n  God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass\r\n  Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found\r\n  In woman, then to studie houshold good,\r\n  And good workes in her Husband to promote.\r\n  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd\r\n  Labour, as to debarr us when we need\r\n  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,\r\n  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\r\n  Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\r\n  To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,\r\n  Love not the lowest end of human life.\r\n  For not to irksom toile, but to delight\r\n  He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.\r\n  These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt\r\n  Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\r\n  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long\r\n  Assist us: But if much converse perhaps\r\n  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.\r\n  For solitude somtimes is best societie,\r\n  And short retirement urges sweet returne.\r\n  But other doubt possesses me, least harm\r\n  Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst\r\n  What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe\r\n  Envying our happiness, and of his own\r\n  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\r\n  By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\r\n  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\r\n  His wish and best advantage, us asunder,\r\n  Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\r\n  To other speedie aide might lend at need;\r\n  Whether his first design be to withdraw\r\n  Our fealtie from God, or to disturb\r\n  Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\r\n  Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;\r\n  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\r\n  That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.\r\n  The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\r\n  Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\r\n  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.\r", "Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud\r\n  Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,\r\n  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\r\n  Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\r\n  Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\r\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\r\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\r\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\r\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\r\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\r\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\r\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\r\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\r\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\r\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\r\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\r\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\r\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\r\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r"],
