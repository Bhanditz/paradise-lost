{"sampleStanzas": ["To whom thus MICHAEL.  Justly thou abhorr'st\r\n  That Son, who on the quiet state of men\r\n  Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue\r\n  Rational Libertie; yet know withall,\r\n  Since thy original lapse, true Libertie\r\n  Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells\r\n  Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:\r\n  Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,\r\n  Immediately inordinate desires\r\n  And upstart Passions catch the Government\r\n  From Reason, and to servitude reduce\r\n  Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits\r\n  Within himself unworthie Powers to reign\r\n  Over free Reason, God in Judgement just\r\n  Subjects him from without to violent Lords;\r\n  Who oft as undeservedly enthrall\r\n  His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\r\n  Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\r\n  Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low\r\n  From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\r\n  But Justice, and some fatal curse annext\r\n  Deprives them of thir outward libertie,\r\n  Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son\r\n  Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame\r\n  Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\r\n  SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race.\r\n  Thus will this latter, as the former World,\r\n  Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last\r\n  Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw\r\n  His presence from among them, and avert\r\n  His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\r\n  To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\r\n  And one peculiar Nation to select\r\n  From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,\r\n  A Nation from one faithful man to spring:\r\n  Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing,\r\n  Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men\r\n  (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\r\n  While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,\r\n  As to forsake the living God, and fall\r\n  To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\r\n  For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\r\n  To call by Vision from his Fathers house,\r\n  His kindred and false Gods, into a Land\r\n  Which he will shew him, and from him will raise\r\n  A mightie Nation, and upon him showre\r\n  His benediction so, that in his Seed\r\n  All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\r\n  Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\r\n  I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\r\n  He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\r\n  UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford\r\n  To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train\r\n  Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\r\n  Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\r\n  With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.\r\n  CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents\r\n  Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine\r\n  Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves\r\n  Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;\r\n  From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South\r\n  (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)\r\n  From HERMON East to the great Western Sea,\r\n  Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold\r\n  In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\r\n  Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream\r\n  JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\r\n  Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills.\r\n  This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\r\n  Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\r\n  Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\r\n  The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\r\n  Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\r\n  Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call,\r\n  A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\r\n  Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\r\n  The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\r\n  From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd\r\n  EGYPT, divided by the River NILE;\r\n  See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\r\n  Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\r\n  He comes invited by a yonger Son\r\n  In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\r\n  Raise him to be the second in that Realme\r\n  Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race\r\n  Growing into a Nation, and now grown\r\n  Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks\r\n  To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\r\n  Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\r\n  Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\r\n  Till by two brethren (those two brethren call\r\n  MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime\r\n  His people from enthralment, they return\r\n  With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.\r\n  But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\r\n  To know thir God, or message to regard,\r\n  Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\r\n  To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\r\n  Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\r\n  With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;\r\n  His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\r\n  Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\r\n  And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\r\n  Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie\r\n  And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;\r\n  What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\r\n  A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\r\n  Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\r\n  Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,\r\n  Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\r\n  Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born\r\n  Of EGYPT must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\r\n  This River-dragon tam'd at length submits\r\n  To let his sojourners depart, and oft\r\n  Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\r\n  More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage\r\n  Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\r\n  Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\r\n  As on drie land between two christal walls,\r\n  Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand\r\n  Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:\r\n  Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\r\n  Though present in his Angel, who shall goe\r\n  Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\r\n  To guide them in thir journey, and remove\r\n  Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:\r\n  All night he will pursue, but his approach\r\n  Darkness defends between till morning Watch;\r\n  Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\r\n  God looking forth will trouble all his Host\r\n  And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\r\n  MOSES once more his potent Rod extends\r\n  Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\r\n  On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\r\n  And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\r\n  Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance\r\n  Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\r\n  Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd\r\n  Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\r\n  Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather\r\n  Inglorious life with servitude; for life\r\n  To noble and ignoble is more sweet\r\n  Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\r\n  This also shall they gain by thir delay\r\n  In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\r\n  Thir government, and thir great Senate choose\r\n  Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\r\n  God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top\r\n  Shall tremble, he descending, will himself\r\n  In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\r\n  Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\r\n  To civil Justice, part religious Rites\r\n  Of sacrifice, informing them, by types\r\n  And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\r\n  The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\r\n  Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\r\n  To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\r\n  That MOSES might report to them his will,\r\n  And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\r\n  Instructed that to God is no access\r\n  Without Mediator, whose high Office now\r\n  MOSES in figure beares, to introduce\r\n  One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\r\n  And all the Prophets in thir Age the times\r\n  Of great MESSIAH shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\r\n  Establisht, such delight hath God in Men\r\n  Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes\r\n  Among them to set up his Tabernacle,\r\n  The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\r\n  By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd\r\n  Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\r\n  An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\r\n  The Records of his Cov'nant, over these\r\n  A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\r\n  Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn\r\n  Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\r\n  The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\r\n  Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\r\n  Save when they journie, and at length they come,\r\n  Conducted by his Angel to the Land\r\n  Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest\r\n  Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,\r\n  How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\r\n  Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still\r\n  A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\r\n  Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand,\r\n  And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON,\r\n  Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third\r\n  From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him\r\n  His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.\r", "Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,\r\n  Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\r\n  Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep\r\n  Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\r\n  Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\r\n  Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\r\n  And opportune excursion we may chance\r\n  Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone\r\n  Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light\r\n  Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam\r\n  Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\r\n  To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\r\n  Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\r\n  In search of this new world, whom shall we find\r\n  Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\r\n  The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss\r\n  And through the palpable obscure find out\r\n  His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\r\n  Upborn with indefatigable wings\r\n  Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\r\n  The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\r\n  Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe\r\n  Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick\r\n  Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need\r\n  All circumspection, and we now no less\r\n  Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\r\n  The weight of all and our last hope relies.\r", "What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth\r\n  With various living creatures, and the Aire\r\n  Replenisht, and all these at thy command\r\n  To come and play before thee, know'st thou not\r\n  Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,\r\n  And reason not contemptibly; with these\r\n  Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.\r\n  So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd\r\n  So ordering.
