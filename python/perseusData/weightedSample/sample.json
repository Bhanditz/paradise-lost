Death thou hast seen\r\n  In his first shape on man; but many shapes\r\n  Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead\r\n  To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\r\n  More terrible at th' entrance then within.\r\n  Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,\r\n  By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\r\n  In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\r\n  Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\r\n  Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\r\n  What miserie th' inabstinence of EVE\r\n  Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place\r\n  Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\r\n  A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\r\n  Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies\r\n  Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\r\n  Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\r\n  Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\r\n  Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\r\n  Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.\r\n  Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\r\n  Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\r\n  And over them triumphant Death his Dart\r\n  Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't\r\n  With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\r\n  Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long\r\n  Drie-ey'd behold?  ADAM could not, but wept,\r\n  Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd\r\n  His best of Man, and gave him up to tears\r\n  A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\r\n  And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.\r", "I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit.\r\n  But is there yet no other way, besides\r\n  These painful passages, how we may come\r\n  To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\r", "He added not, for ADAM at the newes\r\n  Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\r\n  That all his senses bound; EVE, who unseen\r\n  Yet all had heard, with audible lament\r\n  Discover'd soon the place of her retire.\r", "O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\r\n  Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\r\n  Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\r\n  Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\r\n  Quiet though sad, the respit of that day\r\n  That must be mortal to us both.

Ascend\r\n  This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes)\r\n  Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,\r\n  As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\r", "O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n\r\n  To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;\r\n  Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\r", "He ended; and thus ADAM last reply'd.\r\n  How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\r\n  Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,\r\n  Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,\r\n  Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.\r\n  Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,\r\n  Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill\r\n  Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;\r\n  Beyond which was my folly to aspire.\r\n  Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,\r\n  And love with feare the onely God, to walk\r\n  As in his presence, ever to observe\r\n  His providence, and on him sole depend,\r\n  Merciful over all his works, with good\r\n  Still overcoming evil, and by small\r\n  Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak\r\n  Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\r\n  By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake\r\n  Is fortitude to highest victorie,\r\n  And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;\r\n  Taught this by his example whom I now\r\n  Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\r", "To whom thus MICHAEL.  Judg not what is best\r\n  By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\r\n  Created, as thou art, to nobler end\r\n  Holie and pure, conformitie divine.\r\n  Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\r\n  Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\r\n  Who slew his Brother; studious they appere\r\n  Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\r\n  Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\r\n  Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.\r\n  Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\r\n  For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\r\n  Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\r\n  Yet empty of all good wherein consists\r\n  Womans domestic honour and chief praise;\r\n  Bred onely and completed to the taste\r\n  Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\r\n  To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\r\n  To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\r\n  Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,\r\n  Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\r\n  Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles\r\n  Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\r\n  (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\r\n  The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\r", "ADAM by this from the cold sudden damp\r\n  Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\r\n  To MICHAEL thus his humble words addressd.\r", "To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product\r\n  Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;\r\n  Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\r\n  Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\r\n  Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\r\n  Such were these Giants, men of high renown;\r\n  For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,\r\n  And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;\r\n  To overcome in Battel, and subdue\r\n  Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite\r\n  Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\r\n  Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done\r\n  Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,\r\n  Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\r\n  Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.\r\n  Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,\r\n  And what most merits fame in silence hid.\r\n  But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\r\n  The onely righteous in a World perverse,\r\n  And therefore hated, therefore so beset\r\n  With Foes for daring single to be just,\r\n  And utter odious Truth, that God would come\r\n  To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\r\n  Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\r\n  Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\r\n  High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\r\n  Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\r\n  Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;\r\n  Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\r", "To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.\r\n  Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\r\n  Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,\r\n  However chast'ning, to the evil turne\r\n  My obvious breast, arming to overcom\r\n  By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\r\n  If so I may attain.  So both ascend\r\n  In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill\r\n  Of Paradise the highest, from whose top\r\n  The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\r\n  Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.\r\n  Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\r\n  Whereon for different cause the Tempter set\r\n  Our second ADAM in the Wilderness,\r\n  To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\r\n  His Eye might there command wherever stood\r\n  City of old or modern Fame, the Seat\r\n  Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\r\n  Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN\r\n  And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne,\r\n  To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence\r\n  To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL\r\n  Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where\r\n  The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since\r\n  In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR\r\n  In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE,\r\n  TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken\r\n  Th' Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port\r\n  ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings\r\n  MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND,\r\n  And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme\r\n  Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South;\r\n  Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount\r\n  The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS,\r\n  MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN;\r\n  On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway\r\n  The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\r\n  Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME,\r\n  And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat\r\n  Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil'd\r\n  GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons\r\n  Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights\r\n  MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov'd\r\n  VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight\r\n  Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue\r\n  The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\r\n  And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.\r\n  So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,\r\n  Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\r\n  That ADAM now enforc't to close his eyes,\r\n  Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\r\n  But him the gentle Angel by the hand\r\n  Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.\r", "So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate\r\n  Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\r\n  On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd\r\n  After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\r\n  The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour,\r\n  Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\r\n  Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\r\n  First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,\r\n  Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\r\n  Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\r\n  ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase\r\n  Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake.\r", "To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.\r\n  Ill worthie I such title should belong\r\n  To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\r\n  A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\r\n  Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\r\n  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,\r\n  That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\r\n  The sourse of life; next favourable thou,\r\n  Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,\r\n  Farr other name deserving.  But the Field\r\n  To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\r\n  Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\r\n  All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\r\n  Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\r\n  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,\r\n  Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\r\n  Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\r\n  What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\r\n  Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\r", "He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\r\n  Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\r\n  Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze\r\n  Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd\r\n  Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's\r\n  Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,\r\n  Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.\r", "They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\r\n  Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch\r\n  On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\r\n  Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\r\n  Nor did they not perceave the evil plight\r\n  In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\r\n  Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\r\n  Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod\r\n  Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day\r\n  Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud\r\n  Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,\r\n  That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung\r\n  Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:\r\n  So numberless were those bad Angels seen\r\n  Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell\r\n  'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\r\n  Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear\r\n  Of their great Sultan waving to direct\r\n  Thir course, in even ballance down they light\r\n  On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\r\n  A multitude, like which the populous North\r\n  Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass\r\n  RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons\r\n  Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread\r\n  Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.\r\n  Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band\r\n  The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\r\n  Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\r\n  Excelling human, Princely Dignities,\r\n  And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\r\n  Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now\r\n  Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd\r\n  By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\r\n  Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE\r\n  Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\r\n  Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\r\n  By falsities and lyes the greatest part\r\n  Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake\r\n  God their Creator, and th' invisible\r\n  Glory of him, that made them, to transform\r\n  Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd\r\n  With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\r\n  And Devils to adore for Deities:\r\n  Then were they known to men by various Names,\r\n  And various Idols through the Heathen World.\r\n  Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,\r\n  Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\r\n  At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\r\n  Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,\r\n  While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\r\n  The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\r\n  Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix\r\n  Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,\r\n  Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd\r\n  Among the Nations round, and durst abide\r\n  JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd\r\n  Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd\r\n  Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,\r\n  Abominations; and with cursed things\r\n  His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,\r\n  And with their darkness durst affront his light.\r\n  First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood\r\n  Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,\r\n  Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\r\n  Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\r\n  To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE\r\n  Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,\r\n  In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream\r\n  Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such\r\n  Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\r\n  Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build\r\n  His Temple right against the Temple of God\r\n  On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\r\n  The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence\r\n  And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.\r\n  Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,\r\n  From AROER to NEBO, and the wild\r\n  Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON\r\n  And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond\r\n  The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,\r\n  And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.\r\n  PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd\r\n  ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE\r\n  To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\r\n  Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd\r\n  Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\r\n  Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;\r\n  Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.\r\n  With these came they, who from the bordring flood\r\n  Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts\r\n  EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names\r\n  Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,\r\n  These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please\r\n  Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft\r\n  And uncompounded is their Essence pure,\r\n  Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,\r\n  Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\r\n  Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\r\n  Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,\r\n  Can execute their aerie purposes,\r\n  And works of love or enmity fulfill.\r\n  For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook\r\n  Their living strength, and unfrequented left\r\n  His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\r\n  To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low\r\n  Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\r\n  Of despicable foes.  With these in troop\r\n  Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd\r\n  ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;\r\n  To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\r\n  SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,\r\n  In SION also not unsung, where stood\r\n  Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built\r\n  By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\r\n  Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell\r\n  To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind,\r\n  Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd\r\n  The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate\r\n  In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\r\n  While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock\r\n  Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood\r\n  Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale\r\n  Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,\r\n  Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\r\n  EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led\r\n  His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries\r\n  Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one\r\n  Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark\r\n  Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\r\n  In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\r\n  Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:\r\n  DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\r\n  And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\r\n  Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast\r\n  Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,\r\n  And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.\r\n  Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat\r\n  Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks\r\n  Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.\r\n  He also against the house of God was bold:\r\n  A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,\r\n  AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\r\n  Gods Altar to disparage and displace\r\n  For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn\r\n  His odious offrings, and adore the Gods\r\n  Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd\r\n  A crew who under Names of old Renown,\r\n  OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train\r\n  With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd\r\n  Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek\r\n  Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms\r\n  Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape\r\n  Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd\r\n  The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King\r\n  Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,\r\n  Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\r\n  JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd\r\n  From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke\r\n  Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.\r\n  BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\r\n  Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\r\n  Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood\r\n  Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\r\n  In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\r\n  Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd\r\n  With lust and violence the house of God.\r\n  In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\r\n  And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\r\n  Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\r\n  And injury and outrage: And when Night\r\n  Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\r\n  Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.\r\n  Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night\r\n  In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores\r\n  Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\r\n  These were the prime in order and in might;\r\n  The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,\r\n  Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held\r\n  Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth\r\n  Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born\r\n  With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd\r\n  By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE\r\n  His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;\r\n  So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET\r\n  And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top\r\n  Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air\r\n  Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,\r\n  Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds\r\n  Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old\r\n  Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,\r\n  And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.\r\n  All these and more came flocking; but with looks\r\n  Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd\r\n  Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\r\n  Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost\r\n  In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast\r\n  Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\r\n  Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore\r\n  Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd\r\n  Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.\r\n  Then strait commands that at the warlike sound\r\n  Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\r\n  His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd\r\n  AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:\r\n  Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\r\n  Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't\r\n  Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\r\n  With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,\r\n  Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\r\n  Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\r\n  At which the universal Host upsent\r\n  A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\r\n  Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.\r\n  All in a moment through the gloom were seen\r\n  Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air\r\n  With Orient Colours waving: with them rose\r\n  A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\r\n  Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array\r\n  Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move\r\n  In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood\r\n  Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd\r\n  To highth of noblest temper Hero's old\r\n  Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage\r\n  Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd\r\n  With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\r\n  Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage\r\n  With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase\r\n  Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\r\n  From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they\r\n  Breathing united force with fixed thought\r\n  Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd\r\n  Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now\r\n  Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front\r\n  Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\r\n  Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,\r\n  Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief\r\n  Had to impose: He through the armed Files\r\n  Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse\r\n  The whole Battalion views, thir order due,\r\n  Thir visages and stature as of Gods,\r\n  Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart\r\n  Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength\r\n  Glories: For never since created man,\r\n  Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these\r\n  Could merit more then that small infantry\r\n  Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\r\n  Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd\r\n  That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side\r\n  Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\r\n  In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son\r\n  Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;\r\n  And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel\r\n  Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,\r\n  DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,\r\n  Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore\r\n  When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell\r\n  By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond\r\n  Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd\r\n  Thir dread Commander: he above the rest\r\n  In shape and gesture proudly eminent\r\n  Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\r\n  All her Original brightness, nor appear'd\r\n  Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess\r\n  Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n\r\n  Looks through the Horizontal misty Air\r\n  Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\r\n  In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\r\n  On half the Nations, and with fear of change\r\n  Perplexes Monarchs.

Sin and Death amain\r\n  Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n,\r\n  Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way\r\n  Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf\r\n  Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length\r\n  From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe\r\n  Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse\r\n  With easie intercourse pass to and fro\r\n  To tempt or punish mortals, except whom\r\n  God and good Angels guard by special grace.\r\n  But now at last the sacred influence\r\n  Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n\r\n  Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night\r\n  A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins\r\n  Her fardest verge, and CHAOS to retire\r\n  As from her outmost works a brok'n foe\r\n  With tumult less and with less hostile din,\r\n  That SATAN with less toil, and now with ease\r\n  Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\r\n  And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds\r\n  Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;\r\n  Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,\r\n  Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold\r\n  Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide\r\n  In circuit, undetermind square or round,\r\n  With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd\r\n  Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;\r\n  And fast by hanging in a golden Chain\r\n  This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr\r\n  Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.\r\n  Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\r\n  Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.\r", "I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,\r\n  As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd\r\n  Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,\r\n  Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast\r\n  Ominous conjecture on the whole success:\r\n  When he who most excels in fact of Arms,\r\n  In what he counsels and in what excels\r\n  Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\r\n  And utter dissolution, as the scope\r\n  Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.\r\n  First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd\r\n  With Armed watch, that render all access\r\n  Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\r\n  Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing\r\n  Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,\r\n  Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way\r\n  By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\r\n  With blackest Insurrection, to confound\r\n  Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie\r\n  All incorruptible would on his Throne\r\n  Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould\r\n  Incapable of stain would soon expel\r\n  Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire\r\n  Victorious.  Thus repuls'd, our final hope\r\n  Is flat despair: we must exasperate\r\n  Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\r\n  And that must end us, that must be our cure,\r\n  To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\r\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\n  Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,\r\n  To perish rather, swallowd up and lost\r\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\n  Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\r\n  Let this be good, whether our angry Foe\r\n  Can give it, or will ever? how he can\r\n  Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.\r\n  Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\r\n  Belike through impotence, or unaware,\r\n  To give his Enemies thir wish, and end\r\n  Them in his anger, whom his anger saves\r\n  To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\r\n  Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,\r\n  Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;\r\n  Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,\r\n  What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\r\n  Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\r\n  What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook\r\n  With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\r\n  The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd\r\n  A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\r\n  Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\r\n  What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires\r\n  Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage\r\n  And plunge us in the Flames? or from above\r\n  Should intermitted vengeance Arme again\r\n  His red right hand to plague us? what if all\r\n  Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament\r\n  Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\r\n  Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\r\n  One day upon our heads; while we perhaps\r\n  Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,\r\n  Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd\r\n  Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\r\n  Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\r\n  Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\r\n  There to converse with everlasting groans,\r\n  Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\r\n  Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.\r\n  Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike\r\n  My voice disswades; for what can force or guile\r\n  With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\r\n  Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth\r\n  All these our motions vain, sees and derides;\r\n  Not more Almighty to resist our might\r\n  Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\r\n  Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n\r\n  Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here\r\n  Chains & these Torments? better these then worse\r\n  By my advice; since fate inevitable\r\n  Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\r\n  The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\r\n  Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\r\n  That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,\r\n  If we were wise, against so great a foe\r\n  Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.\r\n  I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\r\n  And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\r\n  What yet they know must follow, to endure\r\n  Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\r\n  The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\r\n  Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\r\n  Our Supream Foe in time may much remit\r\n  His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd\r\n  Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd\r\n  With what is punish't; whence these raging fires\r\n  Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\r\n  Our purer essence then will overcome\r\n  Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,\r\n  Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd\r\n  In temper and in nature, will receive\r\n  Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\r\n  This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,\r\n  Besides what hope the never-ending flight\r\n  Of future days may bring, what chance, what change\r\n  Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers\r\n  For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\r\n  If we procure not to our selves more woe.\r", "She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore\r\n  Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.\r\n  Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire,\r\n  And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge\r\n  Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys\r\n  Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\r\n  Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know\r\n  I come no enemie, but to set free\r\n  From out this dark and dismal house of pain,\r\n  Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host\r\n  Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd\r\n  Fell with us from on high: from them I go\r\n  This uncouth errand sole, and one for all\r\n  My self expose, with lonely steps to tread\r\n  Th' unfounded deep, & through the void immense\r\n  To search with wandring quest a place foretold\r\n  Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\r\n  Created vast and round, a place of bliss\r\n  In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't\r\n  A race of upstart Creatures, to supply\r\n  Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd,\r\n  Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude\r\n  Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught\r\n  Then this more secret now design'd, I haste\r\n  To know, and this once known, shall soon return,\r\n  And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death\r\n  Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\r\n  Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd\r\n  With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd\r\n  Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\r\n  He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death\r\n  Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear\r\n  His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe\r\n  Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd\r\n  His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.\r", "So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,\r\n  So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold\r\n  More dreadful and deform: on th' other side\r\n  Incenc't with indignation SATAN stood\r\n  Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd,\r\n  That fires the length of OPHIUCUS huge\r\n  In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair\r\n  Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head\r\n  Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\r\n  No second stroke intend, and such a frown\r\n  Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds\r\n  With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on\r\n  Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front\r\n  Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\r\n  To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:\r\n  So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\r\n  Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;\r\n  For never but once more was either like\r\n  To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\r\n  Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,\r\n  Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\r\n  Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\r\n  Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between.\r", "Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,\r\n  Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now\r\n  Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd\r\n  Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote\r\n  Inclines, here to continue, and build up here\r\n  A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\r\n  And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd\r\n  This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\r\n  Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\r\n  From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League\r\n  Banded against his Throne, but to remaine\r\n  In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,\r\n  Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd\r\n  His captive multitude: For he, be sure,\r\n  In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign\r\n  Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\r\n  By our revolt, but over Hell extend\r\n  His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\r\n  Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.\r\n  What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?\r\n  Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss\r\n  Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none\r\n  Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n\r\n  To us enslav'd, but custody severe,\r\n  And stripes, and arbitrary punishment\r\n  Inflicted? and what peace can we return,\r\n  But to our power hostility and hate,\r\n  Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,\r\n  Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least\r\n  May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\r\n  In doing what we most in suffering feel?\r\n  Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need\r\n  With dangerous expedition to invade\r\n  Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\r\n  Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\r\n  Some easier enterprize?  There is a place\r\n  (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n\r\n  Err not) another World, the happy seat\r\n  Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time\r\n  To be created like to us, though less\r\n  In power and excellence, but favour'd more\r\n  Of him who rules above; so was his will\r\n  Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,\r\n  That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.\r\n  Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\r\n  What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\r\n  Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,\r\n  And where thir weakness, how attempted best,\r\n  By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,\r\n  And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure\r\n  In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd\r\n  The utmost border of his Kingdom, left\r\n  To their defence who hold it: here perhaps\r\n  Som advantagious act may be achiev'd\r\n  By sudden onset, either with Hell fire\r\n  To waste his whole Creation, or possess\r\n  All as our own, and drive as we were driven,\r\n  The punie habitants, or if not drive,\r\n  Seduce them to our Party, that thir God\r\n  May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\r\n  Abolish his own works.  This would surpass\r\n  Common revenge, and interrupt his joy\r\n  In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\r\n  In his disturbance; when his darling Sons\r\n  Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse\r\n  Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,\r\n  Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\r\n  Attempting, or to sit in darkness here\r\n  Hatching vain Empires.  Thus BEELZEBUB\r\n  Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd\r\n  By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence,\r\n  But from the Author of all ill could Spring\r\n  So deep a malice, to confound the race\r\n  Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\r\n  To mingle and involve, done all to spite\r\n  The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves\r\n  His glory to augment.  The bold design\r\n  Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy\r\n  Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent\r\n  They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\r", "Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n\r\n  We warr, if warr be best, or to regain\r\n  Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then\r\n  May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild\r\n  To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:\r\n  The former vain to hope argues as vain\r\n  The latter: for what place can be for us\r\n  Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream\r\n  We overpower?  Suppose he should relent\r\n  And publish Grace to all, on promise made\r\n  Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we\r\n  Stand in his presence humble, and receive\r\n  Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne\r\n  With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\r\n  Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits\r\n  Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\r\n  Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\r\n  Our servile offerings.  This must be our task\r\n  In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom\r\n  Eternity so spent in worship paid\r\n  To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\r\n  By force impossible, by leave obtain'd\r\n  Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state\r\n  Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek\r\n  Our own good from our selves, and from our own\r\n  Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,\r\n  Free, and to none accountable, preferring\r\n  Hard liberty before the easie yoke\r\n  Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\r\n  Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,\r\n  Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\r\n  We can create, and in what place so e're\r\n  Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\r\n  Through labour and endurance.  This deep world\r\n  Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst\r\n  Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire\r\n  Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,\r\n  And with the Majesty of darkness round\r\n  Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\r\n  Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?\r\n  As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light\r\n  Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile\r\n  Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\r\n  Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise\r\n  Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?\r\n  Our torments also may in length of time\r\n  Become our Elements, these piercing Fires\r\n  As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd\r\n  Into their temper; which must needs remove\r\n  The sensible of pain.  All things invite\r\n  To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State\r\n  Of order, how in safety best we may\r\n  Compose our present evils, with regard\r\n  Of what we are and where, dismissing quite\r\n  All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.\r", "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\r\n  Thou interposest, that my sudden hand\r\n  Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\r\n  What it intends; till first I know of thee,\r\n  What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why\r\n  In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st\r\n  Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son?\r\n  I know thee not, nor ever saw till now\r\n  Sight more detestable then him and thee.\r", "Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,\r\n  SATAN with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,\r\n  Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell\r\n  Explores his solitary flight; som times\r\n  He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,\r\n  Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares\r\n  Up to the fiery concave touring high.\r\n  As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd\r\n  Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds\r\n  Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles\r\n  Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring\r\n  Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood\r\n  Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape\r\n  Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem'd\r\n  Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer\r\n  Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,\r\n  And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass\r\n  Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\r\n  Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire,\r\n  Yet unconsum'd.  Before the Gates there sat\r\n  On either side a formidable shape;\r\n  The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair,\r\n  But ended foul in many a scaly fould\r\n  Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd\r\n  With mortal sting: about her middle round\r\n  A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd\r\n  With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung\r\n  A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\r\n  If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb,\r\n  And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd\r\n  Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these\r\n  Vex'd SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts\r\n  CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore:\r\n  Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd\r\n  In secret, riding through the Air she comes\r\n  Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance\r\n  With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon\r\n  Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,\r\n  If shape it might be call'd that shape had none\r\n  Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,\r\n  Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,\r\n  For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night,\r\n  Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\r\n  And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head\r\n  The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\r\n  SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat\r\n  The Monster moving onward came as fast,\r\n  With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\r\n  Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,\r\n  Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except,\r\n  Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd;\r\n  And with disdainful look thus first began.\r", "Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,\r\n  That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance\r\n  Thy miscreated Front athwart my way\r\n  To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\r\n  That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee:\r\n  Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\r\n  Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n.\r", "O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,\r\n  Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,\r\n  Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\r\n  Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom;\r\n  For him who sits above and laughs the while\r\n  At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute\r\n  What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,\r\n  His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\r", "Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,\r\n  Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\r\n  Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep\r\n  Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\r\n  Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\r\n  Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\r\n  And opportune excursion we may chance\r\n  Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone\r\n  Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light\r\n  Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam\r\n  Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\r\n  To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\r\n  Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\r\n  In search of this new world, whom shall we find\r\n  Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\r\n  The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss\r\n  And through the palpable obscure find out\r\n  His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\r\n  Upborn with indefatigable wings\r\n  Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\r\n  The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\r\n  Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe\r\n  Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick\r\n  Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need\r\n  All circumspection, and we now no less\r\n  Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\r\n  The weight of all and our last hope relies.\r", "T' whom SATAN turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers\r\n  And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,\r\n  CHAOS and ANCIENT NIGHT, I come no Spie,\r\n  With purpose to explore or to disturb\r\n  The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint\r\n  Wandring this darksome desart, as my way\r\n  Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,\r\n  Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek\r\n  What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds\r\n  Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place\r\n  From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King\r\n  Possesses lately, thither to arrive\r\n  I travel this profound, direct my course;\r\n  Directed, no mean recompence it brings\r\n  To your behoof, if I that Region lost,\r\n  All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce\r\n  To her original darkness and your sway\r\n  (Which is my present journey) and once more\r\n  Erect the Standerd there of ANCIENT NIGHT;\r\n  Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge.\r", "O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace\r\n  Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou\r\n  My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear,\r\n  To me are all my works, nor Man the least\r\n  Though last created, that for him I spare\r\n  Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,\r\n  By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.\r\n  Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,\r\n  Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;\r\n  And be thy self Man among men on Earth,\r\n  Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,\r\n  By wondrous birth: Be thou in ADAMS room\r\n  The Head of all mankind, though ADAMS Son.\r\n  As in him perish all men, so in thee\r\n  As from a second root shall be restor'd,\r\n  As many as are restor'd, without thee none.\r\n  His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit\r\n  Imputed shall absolve them who renounce\r\n  Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,\r\n  And live in thee transplanted, and from thee\r\n  Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,\r\n  Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die,\r\n  And dying rise, and rising with him raise\r\n  His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.\r\n  So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,\r\n  Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,\r\n  So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate\r\n  So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes\r\n  In those who, when they may, accept not grace.\r\n  Nor shalt thou by descending to assume\r\n  Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne.\r\n  Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss\r\n  Equal to God, and equally enjoying\r\n  God-like fruition, quitted all to save\r\n  A World from utter loss, and hast been found\r\n  By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,\r\n  Found worthiest to be so by being Good,\r\n  Farr more then Great or High; because in thee\r\n  Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,\r\n  Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt\r\n  With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;\r\n  Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne\r\n  Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,\r\n  Anointed universal King; all Power\r\n  I give thee, reign for ever, and assume\r\n  Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream\r\n  Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:\r\n  All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide\r\n  In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;\r\n  When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n\r\n  Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send\r\n  The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime\r\n  Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes\r\n  The living, and forthwith the cited dead\r\n  Of all past Ages to the general Doom\r\n  Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.\r\n  Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge\r\n  Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink\r\n  Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,\r\n  Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while\r\n  The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell\r\n  And after all thir tribulations long\r\n  See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,\r\n  With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.\r\n  Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,\r\n  For regal Scepter then no more shall need,\r\n  God shall be All in All.

from Eastern Point\r\n  Of LIBRA to the fleecie Starr that bears\r\n  ANDROMEDA farr off ATLANTICK Seas\r\n  Beyond th' HORIZON; then from Pole to Pole\r\n  He views in bredth, and without longer pause\r\n  Down right into the Worlds first Region throws\r\n  His flight precipitant, and windes with ease\r\n  Through the pure marble Air his oblique way\r\n  Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon\r\n  Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,\r\n  Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,\r\n  Like those HESPERIAN Gardens fam'd of old,\r\n  Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,\r\n  Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there\r\n  He stayd not to enquire: above them all\r\n  The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven\r\n  Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends\r\n  Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe\r\n  By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,\r\n  Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie\r\n  Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,\r\n  That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,\r\n  Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move\r\n  Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute\r\n  Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp\r\n  Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd\r\n  By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms\r\n  The Univers, and to each inward part\r\n  With gentle penetration, though unseen,\r\n  Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:\r\n  So wondrously was set his Station bright.\r\n  There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps\r\n  Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe\r\n  Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw.\r\n  The place he found beyond expression bright,\r\n  Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;\r\n  Not all parts like, but all alike informd\r\n  With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;\r\n  If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;\r\n  If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,\r\n  Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon\r\n  In AARONS Brest-plate, and a stone besides\r\n  Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,\r\n  That stone, or like to that which here below\r\n  Philosophers in vain so long have sought,\r\n  In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde\r\n  Volatil HERMES, and call up unbound\r\n  In various shapes old PROTEUS from the Sea,\r\n  Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.\r\n  What wonder then if fields and regions here\r\n  Breathe forth ELIXIR pure, and Rivers run\r\n  Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch\r\n  Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote\r\n  Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt\r\n  Here in the dark so many precious things\r\n  Of colour glorious and effect so rare?\r\n  Here matter new to gaze the Devil met\r\n  Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands,\r\n  For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,\r\n  But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon\r\n  Culminate from th' AEQUATOR, as they now\r\n  Shot upward still direct, whence no way round\r\n  Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,\r\n  No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray\r\n  To objects distant farr, whereby he soon\r\n  Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,\r\n  The same whom JOHN saw also in the Sun:\r\n  His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;\r\n  Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar\r\n  Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind\r\n  Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings\r\n  Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd\r\n  Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.\r\n  Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope\r\n  To find who might direct his wandring flight\r\n  To Paradise the happie seat of Man,\r\n  His journies end and our beginning woe.\r\n  But first he casts to change his proper shape,\r\n  Which else might work him danger or delay:\r\n  And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,\r\n  Not of the prime, yet such as in his face\r\n  Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb\r\n  Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd;\r\n  Under a Coronet his flowing haire\r\n  In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore\r\n  Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold,\r\n  His habit fit for speed succinct, and held\r\n  Before his decent steps a Silver wand.\r\n  He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,\r\n  Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,\r\n  Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known\r\n  Th' Arch-Angel URIEL, one of the seav'n\r\n  Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne\r\n  Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes\r\n  That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth\r\n  Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,\r\n  O're Sea and Land: him SATAN thus accostes;\r", "Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage\r\n  Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds\r\n  Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains\r\n  Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss\r\n  Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems\r\n  On desperat revenge, that shall redound\r\n  Upon his own rebellious head.

O fleeting joyes\r\n  Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!\r\n  Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay\r\n  To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee\r\n  From darkness to promote me, or here place\r\n  In this delicious Garden? as my Will\r\n  Concurd not to my being, it were but right\r\n  And equal to reduce me to my dust,\r\n  Desirous to resigne, and render back\r\n  All I receav'd, unable to performe\r\n  Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold\r\n  The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,\r\n  Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added\r\n  The sense of endless woes? inexplicable\r\n  Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,\r\n  I thus contest; then should have been refusd\r\n  Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:\r\n  Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,\r\n  Then cavil the conditions? and though God\r\n  Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son\r\n  Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,\r\n  Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:\r\n  Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee\r\n  That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,\r\n  But Natural necessity begot.\r\n  God made thee of choice his own, and of his own\r\n  To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,\r\n  Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.\r\n  Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\r\n  That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:\r\n  O welcom hour whenever! why delayes\r\n  His hand to execute what his Decree\r\n  Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,\r\n  Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out\r\n  To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet\r\n  Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth\r\n  Insensible, how glad would lay me down\r\n  As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest\r\n  And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more\r\n  Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse\r\n  To mee and to my ofspring would torment me\r\n  With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt\r\n  Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,\r\n  Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man\r\n  Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish\r\n  With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,\r\n  Or in some other dismal place, who knows\r\n  But I shall die a living Death?  O thought\r\n  Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath\r\n  Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life\r\n  And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.\r\n  All of me then shall die: let this appease\r\n  The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.\r\n  For though the Lord of all be infinite,\r\n  Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,\r\n  But mortal doom'd.  How can he exercise\r\n  Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?\r\n  Can he make deathless Death? that were to make\r\n  Strange contradiction, which to God himself\r\n  Impossible is held, as Argument\r\n  Of weakness, not of Power.

But say\r\n  That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,\r\n  Bereaving sense, but endless miserie\r\n  From this day onward, which I feel begun\r\n  Both in me, and without me, and so last\r\n  To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear\r\n  Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution\r\n  On my defensless head; both Death and I\r\n  Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,\r\n  Nor I on my part single, in mee all\r\n  Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie\r\n  That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able\r\n  To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!\r\n  So disinherited how would ye bless\r\n  Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind\r\n  For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,\r\n  If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,\r\n  But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,\r\n  Not to do onely, but to will the same\r\n  With me? how can they acquitted stand\r\n  In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes\r\n  Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain\r\n  And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still\r\n  But to my own conviction: first and last\r\n  On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring\r\n  Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;\r\n  So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support\r\n  That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,\r\n  Then all the world much heavier, though divided\r\n  With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir'st,\r\n  And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope\r\n  Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable\r\n  Beyond all past example and future,\r\n  To SATAN onely like both crime and doom.\r\n  O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears\r\n  And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which\r\n  I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd!\r", "Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud\r\n  Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,\r\n  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\r\n  Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\r\n  Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.

At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r", "So having said, he thus to EVE in few:\r\n  Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?\r", "Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act\r\n  Of SATAN done in Paradise, and how\r\n  Hee in the Serpent had perverted EVE,\r\n  Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,\r\n  Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye\r\n  Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart\r\n  Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,\r\n  Hinder'd not SATAN to attempt the minde\r\n  Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm'd,\r\n  Complete to have discover'd and repulst\r\n  Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.\r\n  For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd\r\n  The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,\r\n  Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,\r\n  Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,\r\n  And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.\r\n  Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast\r\n  Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad\r\n  For Man, for of his state by this they knew,\r\n  Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln\r\n  Entrance unseen.

Th' other way SATAN went down\r\n  The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side\r\n  Disparted CHAOS over built exclaimd,\r\n  And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,\r\n  That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,\r\n  Wide open and unguarded, SATAN pass'd,\r\n  And all about found desolate; for those\r\n  Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,\r\n  Flown to the upper World; the rest were all\r\n  Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls\r\n  Of PANDEMONIUM, Citie and proud seate\r\n  Of LUCIFER, so by allusion calld,\r\n  Of that bright Starr to SATAN paragond.\r\n  There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand\r\n  In Council sate, sollicitous what chance\r\n  Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee\r\n  Departing gave command, and they observ'd.\r\n  As when the TARTAR from his RUSSIAN Foe\r\n  By ASTRACAN over the Snowie Plaines\r\n  Retires, or BACTRIAN Sophi from the hornes\r\n  Of TURKISH Crescent, leaves all waste beyond\r\n  The Realme of ALADULE, in his retreate\r\n  To TAURIS or CASBEEN.

But for thee\r\n  I had persisted happie, had not thy pride\r\n  And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,\r\n  Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd\r\n  Not to be trusted, longing to be seen\r\n  Though by the Devil himself, him overweening\r\n  To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting\r\n  Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,\r\n  To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,\r\n  Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,\r\n  And understood not all was but a shew\r\n  Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib\r\n  Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,\r\n  More to the part sinister from me drawn,\r\n  Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie\r\n  To my just number found.

Therefore while I\r\n  Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease\r\n  To my associate Powers, them to acquaint\r\n  With these successes, and with them rejoyce,\r\n  You two this way, among those numerous Orbs\r\n  All yours, right down to Paradise descend;\r\n  There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth\r\n  Dominion exercise and in the Aire,\r\n  Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,\r\n  Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.\r\n  My Substitutes I send ye, and Create\r\n  Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might\r\n  Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now\r\n  My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,\r\n  Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.\r\n  If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell\r\n  No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.\r", "To whom sad EVE with shame nigh overwhelm'd,\r\n  Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge\r\n  Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.\r", "So having said, a while he stood, expecting\r\n  Thir universal shout and high applause\r\n  To fill his eare, when contrary he hears\r\n  On all sides, from innumerable tongues\r\n  A dismal universal hiss, the sound\r\n  Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\r\n  Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;\r\n  His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\r\n  His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\r\n  Each other, till supplanted down he fell\r\n  A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\r\n  Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\r\n  Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,\r\n  According to his doom: he would have spoke,\r\n  But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\r\n  To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd\r\n  Alike, to Serpents all as accessories\r\n  To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\r\n  Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\r\n  With complicated monsters, head and taile,\r\n  Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire,\r\n  CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear,\r\n  And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil\r\n  Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\r\n  OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst,\r\n  Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\r\n  Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime,\r\n  Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd\r\n  Above the rest still to retain; they all\r\n  Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,\r\n  Where all yet left of that revolted Rout\r\n  Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,\r\n  Sublime with expectation when to see\r\n  In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\r\n  They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\r\n  Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\r\n  And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\r\n  They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\r\n  Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\r\n  And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form\r\n  Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\r\n  As in thir crime.  Thus was th' applause they meant,\r\n  Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\r\n  Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\r\n  A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\r\n  His will who reigns above, to aggravate\r\n  Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\r\n  VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE\r\n  Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\r\n  Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining\r\n  For one forbidden Tree a multitude\r\n  Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;\r\n  Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\r\n  Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,\r\n  But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\r\n  Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\r\n  That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd\r\n  The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\r\n  Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd;\r\n  This more delusive, not the touch, but taste\r\n  Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay\r\n  Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\r\n  Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste\r\n  VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\r\n  Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\r\n  VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws\r\n  VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell\r\n  Into the same illusion, not as Man\r\n  Whom they triumph'd once lapst.  Thus were they plagu'd\r\n  And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\r\n  Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,\r\n  Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\r\n  This annual humbling certain number'd days,\r\n  To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.\r\n  However some tradition they dispers'd\r\n  Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,\r\n  And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld\r\n  OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide-\r\n  Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule\r\n  Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n\r\n  And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born.\r\n  Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair\r\n  Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before,\r\n  Once actual, now in body, and to dwell\r\n  Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH\r\n  Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet\r\n  On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began.\r", "She ended heer, or vehement despaire\r\n  Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts\r\n  Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.\r\n  But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd,\r\n  To better hopes his more attentive minde\r\n  Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd.\r", "Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.\r\n  Goe whither Fate and inclination strong\r\n  Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre\r\n  The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw\r\n  Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste\r\n  The savour of Death from all things there that live:\r\n  Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest\r\n  Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.\r"]
