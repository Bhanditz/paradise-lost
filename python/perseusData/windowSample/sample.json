Long were to tell\r\n  What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine\r\n  Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep\r\n  Of horrible confusion, over which\r\n  By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd\r\n  To expedite your glorious march; but I\r\n  Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride\r\n  Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb\r\n  Of unoriginal NIGHT and CHAOS wilde,\r\n  That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd\r\n  My journey strange, with clamorous uproare\r\n  Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found\r\n  The new created World, which fame in Heav'n\r\n  Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful\r\n  Of absolute perfection, therein Man\r\n  Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile\r\n  Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd\r\n  From his Creator, and the more to increase\r\n  Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat\r\n  Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up\r\n  Both his beloved Man and all his World,\r\n  To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,\r\n  Without our hazard, labour or allarme,\r\n  To range in, and to dwell, and over Man\r\n  To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.\r\n  True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather\r\n  Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape\r\n  Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,\r\n  Is enmity, which he will put between\r\n  Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;\r\n  His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:\r\n  A World who would not purchase with a bruise,\r\n  Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th' account\r\n  Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,\r\n  But up and enter now into full bliss.\r", "So having said, a while he stood, expecting\r\n  Thir universal shout and high applause\r\n  To fill his eare, when contrary he hears\r\n  On all sides, from innumerable tongues\r\n  A dismal universal hiss, the sound\r\n  Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\r\n  Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;\r\n  His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\r\n  His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\r\n  Each other, till supplanted down he fell\r\n  A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\r\n  Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\r\n  Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,\r\n  According to his doom: he would have spoke,\r\n  But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\r\n  To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd\r\n  Alike, to Serpents all as accessories\r\n  To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\r\n  Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\r\n  With complicated monsters, head and taile,\r\n  Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire,\r\n  CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear,\r\n  And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil\r\n  Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\r\n  OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst,\r\n  Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\r\n  Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime,\r\n  Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd\r\n  Above the rest still to retain; they all\r\n  Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,\r\n  Where all yet left of that revolted Rout\r\n  Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,\r\n  Sublime with expectation when to see\r\n  In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\r\n  They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\r\n  Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\r\n  And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\r\n  They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\r\n  Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\r\n  And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form\r\n  Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\r\n  As in thir crime.  Thus was th' applause they meant,\r\n  Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\r\n  Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\r\n  A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\r\n  His will who reigns above, to aggravate\r\n  Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\r\n  VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE\r\n  Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\r\n  Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining\r\n  For one forbidden Tree a multitude\r\n  Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;\r\n  Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\r\n  Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,\r\n  But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\r\n  Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\r\n  That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd\r\n  The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\r\n  Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd;\r\n  This more delusive, not the touch, but taste\r\n  Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay\r\n  Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\r\n  Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste\r\n  VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\r\n  Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\r\n  VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws\r\n  VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell\r\n  Into the same illusion, not as Man\r\n  Whom they triumph'd once lapst.  Thus were they plagu'd\r\n  And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\r\n  Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,\r\n  Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\r\n  This annual humbling certain number'd days,\r\n  To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.\r\n  However some tradition they dispers'd\r\n  Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,\r\n  And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld\r\n  OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide-\r\n  Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule\r\n  Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n\r\n  And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born.\r\n  Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair\r\n  Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before,\r\n  Once actual, now in body, and to dwell\r\n  Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH\r\n  Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet\r\n  On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began.\r", "Second of SATAN sprung, all conquering Death,\r\n  What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd\r\n  With travail difficult, not better farr\r\n  Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,\r\n  Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd?\r", "Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,\r\n  That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance\r\n  Thy miscreated Front athwart my way\r\n  To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\r\n  That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee:\r\n  Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\r\n  Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n.\r", "To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd,\r\n  Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,\r\n  Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then\r\n  Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms\r\n  Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons\r\n  Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou\r\n  And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd\r\n  To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?\r\n  And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n,\r\n  Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,\r\n  Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\r\n  Thy King and Lord?

Each at the Head\r\n  Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\r\n  No second stroke intend, and such a frown\r\n  Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds\r\n  With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on\r\n  Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front\r\n  Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\r\n  To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:\r\n  So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\r\n  Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;\r\n  For never but once more was either like\r\n  To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\r\n  Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,\r\n  Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\r\n  Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\r\n  Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between.\r", "O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,\r\n  Against thy only Son?

Therefore since hee permits\r\n  Within himself unworthie Powers to reign\r\n  Over free Reason, God in Judgement just\r\n  Subjects him from without to violent Lords;\r\n  Who oft as undeservedly enthrall\r\n  His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\r\n  Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\r\n  Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low\r\n  From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\r\n  But Justice, and some fatal curse annext\r\n  Deprives them of thir outward libertie,\r\n  Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son\r\n  Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame\r\n  Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\r\n  SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race.\r\n  Thus will this latter, as the former World,\r\n  Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last\r\n  Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw\r\n  His presence from among them, and avert\r\n  His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\r\n  To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\r\n  And one peculiar Nation to select\r\n  From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,\r\n  A Nation from one faithful man to spring:\r\n  Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing,\r\n  Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men\r\n  (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\r\n  While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,\r\n  As to forsake the living God, and fall\r\n  To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\r\n  For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\r\n  To call by Vision from his Fathers house,\r\n  His kindred and false Gods, into a Land\r\n  Which he will shew him, and from him will raise\r\n  A mightie Nation, and upon him showre\r\n  His benediction so, that in his Seed\r\n  All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\r\n  Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\r\n  I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\r\n  He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\r\n  UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford\r\n  To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train\r\n  Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\r\n  Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\r\n  With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.\r\n  CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents\r\n  Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine\r\n  Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves\r\n  Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;\r\n  From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South\r\n  (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)\r\n  From HERMON East to the great Western Sea,\r\n  Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold\r\n  In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\r\n  Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream\r\n  JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\r\n  Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills.\r\n  This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\r\n  Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\r\n  Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\r\n  The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\r\n  Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\r\n  Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call,\r\n  A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\r\n  Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\r\n  The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\r\n  From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd\r\n  EGYPT, divided by the River NILE;\r\n  See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\r\n  Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\r\n  He comes invited by a yonger Son\r\n  In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\r\n  Raise him to be the second in that Realme\r\n  Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race\r\n  Growing into a Nation, and now grown\r\n  Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks\r\n  To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\r\n  Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\r\n  Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\r\n  Till by two brethren (those two brethren call\r\n  MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime\r\n  His people from enthralment, they return\r\n  With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.\r\n  But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\r\n  To know thir God, or message to regard,\r\n  Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\r\n  To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\r\n  Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\r\n  With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;\r\n  His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\r\n  Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\r\n  And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\r\n  Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie\r\n  And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;\r\n  What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\r\n  A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\r\n  Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\r\n  Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,\r\n  Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\r\n  Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born\r\n  Of EGYPT must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\r\n  This River-dragon tam'd at length submits\r\n  To let his sojourners depart, and oft\r\n  Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\r\n  More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage\r\n  Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\r\n  Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\r\n  As on drie land between two christal walls,\r\n  Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand\r\n  Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:\r\n  Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\r\n  Though present in his Angel, who shall goe\r\n  Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\r\n  To guide them in thir journey, and remove\r\n  Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:\r\n  All night he will pursue, but his approach\r\n  Darkness defends between till morning Watch;\r\n  Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\r\n  God looking forth will trouble all his Host\r\n  And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\r\n  MOSES once more his potent Rod extends\r\n  Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\r\n  On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\r\n  And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\r\n  Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance\r\n  Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\r\n  Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd\r\n  Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\r\n  Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather\r\n  Inglorious life with servitude; for life\r\n  To noble and ignoble is more sweet\r\n  Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\r\n  This also shall they gain by thir delay\r\n  In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\r\n  Thir government, and thir great Senate choose\r\n  Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\r\n  God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top\r\n  Shall tremble, he descending, will himself\r\n  In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\r\n  Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\r\n  To civil Justice, part religious Rites\r\n  Of sacrifice, informing them, by types\r\n  And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\r\n  The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\r\n  Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\r\n  To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\r\n  That MOSES might report to them his will,\r\n  And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\r\n  Instructed that to God is no access\r\n  Without Mediator, whose high Office now\r\n  MOSES in figure beares, to introduce\r\n  One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\r\n  And all the Prophets in thir Age the times\r\n  Of great MESSIAH shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\r\n  Establisht, such delight hath God in Men\r\n  Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes\r\n  Among them to set up his Tabernacle,\r\n  The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\r\n  By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd\r\n  Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\r\n  An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\r\n  The Records of his Cov'nant, over these\r\n  A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\r\n  Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn\r\n  Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\r\n  The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\r\n  Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\r\n  Save when they journie, and at length they come,\r\n  Conducted by his Angel to the Land\r\n  Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest\r\n  Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,\r\n  How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\r\n  Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still\r\n  A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\r\n  Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand,\r\n  And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON,\r\n  Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third\r\n  From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him\r\n  His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.\r", "Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\r\n  With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\r\n  That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides\r\n  Prone on the Flood, extended long and large\r\n  Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\r\n  As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\r\n  TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,\r\n  BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den\r\n  By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast\r\n  LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works\r\n  Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:\r\n  Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam\r\n  The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,\r\n  Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\r\n  With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\r\n  Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night\r\n  Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\r\n  So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\r\n  Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\r\n  Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will\r\n  And high permission of all-ruling Heaven\r\n  Left him at large to his own dark designs,\r\n  That with reiterated crimes he might\r\n  Heap on himself damnation, while he sought\r\n  Evil to others, and enrag'd might see\r\n  How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth\r\n  Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\r\n  On Man by him seduc't, but on himself\r\n  Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.\r\n  Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\r\n  His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\r\n  Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld\r\n  In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.\r\n  Then with expanded wings he stears his flight\r\n  Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\r\n  That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\r\n  He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd\r\n  With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\r\n  And such appear'd in hue, as when the force\r\n  Of subterranean wind transports a Hill\r\n  Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side\r\n  Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible\r\n  And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,\r\n  Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\r\n  And leave a singed bottom all involv'd\r\n  With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\r\n  Of unblest feet.

But know that in the Soule\r\n  Are many lesser Faculties that serve\r\n  Reason as chief; among these Fansie next\r\n  Her office holds; of all external things,\r\n  Which the five watchful Senses represent,\r\n  She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,\r\n  Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames\r\n  All what we affirm or what deny, and call\r\n  Our knowledge or opinion; then retires\r\n  Into her private Cell when Nature rests.\r\n  Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes\r\n  To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,\r\n  Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,\r\n  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.\r\n  Som such resemblances methinks I find\r\n  Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,\r\n  But with addition strange; yet be not sad.\r\n  Evil into the mind of God or Man\r\n  May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave\r\n  No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope\r\n  That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,\r\n  Waking thou never wilt consent to do.\r\n  Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks\r\n  That wont to be more chearful and serene\r\n  Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,\r\n  And let us to our fresh imployments rise\r\n  Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours\r\n  That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells\r\n  Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.\r", "So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,\r\n  But silently a gentle tear let fall\r\n  From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;\r\n  Two other precious drops that ready stood,\r\n  Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell\r\n  Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\r\n  And pious awe, that feard to have offended.\r", "She ended heer, or vehement despaire\r\n  Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts\r\n  Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.\r\n  But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd,\r\n  To better hopes his more attentive minde\r\n  Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd.\r", "EVE, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems\r\n  To argue in thee somthing more sublime\r\n  And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;\r\n  But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes\r\n  That excellence thought in thee, and implies,\r\n  Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret\r\n  For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.\r\n  Or if thou covet death, as utmost end\r\n  Of miserie, so thinking to evade\r\n  The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God\r\n  Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so\r\n  To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death\r\n  So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine\r\n  We are by doom to pay; rather such acts\r\n  Of contumacie will provoke the highest\r\n  To make death in us live: Then let us seek\r\n  Som safer resolution, which methinks\r\n  I have in view, calling to minde with heed\r\n  Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise\r\n  The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless\r\n  Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe\r\n  SATAN, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd\r\n  Against us this deceit: to crush his head\r\n  Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost\r\n  By death brought on our selves, or childless days\r\n  Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe\r\n  Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee\r\n  Instead shall double ours upon our heads.\r\n  No more be mention'd then of violence\r\n  Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,\r\n  That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely\r\n  Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,\r\n  Reluctance against God and his just yoke\r\n  Laid on our Necks.

Idleness had bin worse;\r\n  My labour will sustain me; and least Cold\r\n  Or Heat should injure us, his timely care\r\n  Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands\r\n  Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;\r\n  How much more, if we pray him, will his ear\r\n  Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,\r\n  And teach us further by what means to shun\r\n  Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,\r\n  Which now the Skie with various Face begins\r\n  To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds\r\n  Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks\r\n  Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek\r\n  Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish\r\n  Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr\r\n  Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams\r\n  Reflected, may with matter sere foment,\r\n  Or by collision of two bodies grinde\r\n  The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds\r\n  Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock\r\n  Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down\r\n  Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,\r\n  And sends a comfortable heat from farr,\r\n  Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,\r\n  And what may else be remedie or cure\r\n  To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,\r\n  Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace\r\n  Beseeching him, so as we need not fear\r\n  To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd\r\n  By him with many comforts, till we end\r\n  In dust, our final rest and native home.\r\n  What better can we do, then to the place\r\n  Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall\r\n  Before him reverent, and there confess\r\n  Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears\r\n  VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air\r\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\r\n  Undoubtedly he will relent and turn\r\n  From his displeasure; in whose look serene,\r\n  VVhen angry most he seem'd and most severe,\r\n  VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?\r", "So spake our Father penitent, nor EVE\r\n  Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place\r\n  Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell\r\n  Before him reverent, and both confess'd\r\n  Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears\r\n  VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air\r\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\r", "Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood\r\n  Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above\r\n  Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd\r\n  The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh\r\n  Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd\r\n  Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer\r\n  Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight\r\n  Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port\r\n  Not of mean suiters, nor important less\r\n  Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair\r\n  In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,\r\n  DEUCALION and chaste PYRRHA to restore\r\n  The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine\r\n  Of THEMIS stood devout.  To Heav'n thir prayers\r\n  Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes\r\n  Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd\r\n  Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad\r\n  With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,\r\n  By thir great Intercessor, came in sight\r\n  Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son\r\n  Presenting, thus to intercede began.\r", "He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\r\n  Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\r\n  The sound of blustring winds, which all night long\r\n  Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\r\n  Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\r\n  Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\r\n  After the Tempest: Such applause was heard\r\n  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,\r\n  Advising peace: for such another Field\r\n  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\r\n  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL\r\n  Wrought still within them; and no less desire\r\n  To found this nether Empire, which might rise\r\n  By pollicy, and long process of time,\r\n  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.\r\n  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,\r\n  SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave\r\n  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd\r\n  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and publick care;\r\n  And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\r\n  Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood\r\n  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear\r\n  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\r\n  Drew audience and attention still as Night\r\n  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\r", "Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,\r\n  Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now\r\n  Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd\r\n  Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote\r\n  Inclines, here to continue, and build up here\r\n  A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\r\n  And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd\r\n  This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\r\n  Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\r\n  From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League\r\n  Banded against his Throne, but to remaine\r\n  In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,\r\n  Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd\r\n  His captive multitude: For he, be sure,\r\n  In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign\r\n  Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\r\n  By our revolt, but over Hell extend\r\n  His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\r\n  Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.\r\n  What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?\r\n  Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss\r\n  Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none\r\n  Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n\r\n  To us enslav'd, but custody severe,\r\n  And stripes, and arbitrary punishment\r\n  Inflicted? and what peace can we return,\r\n  But to our power hostility and hate,\r\n  Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,\r\n  Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least\r\n  May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\r\n  In doing what we most in suffering feel?\r\n  Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need\r\n  With dangerous expedition to invade\r\n  Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\r\n  Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\r\n  Some easier enterprize?  There is a place\r\n  (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n\r\n  Err not) another World, the happy seat\r\n  Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time\r\n  To be created like to us, though less\r\n  In power and excellence, but favour'd more\r\n  Of him who rules above; so was his will\r\n  Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,\r\n  That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.\r\n  Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\r\n  What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\r\n  Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,\r\n  And where thir weakness, how attempted best,\r\n  By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,\r\n  And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure\r\n  In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd\r\n  The utmost border of his Kingdom, left\r\n  To their defence who hold it: here perhaps\r\n  Som advantagious act may be achiev'd\r\n  By sudden onset, either with Hell fire\r\n  To waste his whole Creation, or possess\r\n  All as our own, and drive as we were driven,\r\n  The punie habitants, or if not drive,\r\n  Seduce them to our Party, that thir God\r\n  May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\r\n  Abolish his own works.  This would surpass\r\n  Common revenge, and interrupt his joy\r\n  In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\r\n  In his disturbance; when his darling Sons\r\n  Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse\r\n  Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,\r\n  Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\r\n  Attempting, or to sit in darkness here\r\n  Hatching vain Empires.  Thus BEELZEBUB\r\n  Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd\r\n  By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence,\r\n  But from the Author of all ill could Spring\r\n  So deep a malice, to confound the race\r\n  Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\r\n  To mingle and involve, done all to spite\r\n  The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves\r\n  His glory to augment.  The bold design\r\n  Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy\r\n  Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent\r\n  They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\r", "Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,\r\n  Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\r\n  Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep\r\n  Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\r\n  Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\r\n  Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\r\n  And opportune excursion we may chance\r\n  Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone\r\n  Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light\r\n  Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam\r\n  Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\r\n  To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\r\n  Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\r\n  In search of this new world, whom shall we find\r\n  Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\r\n  The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss\r\n  And through the palpable obscure find out\r\n  His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\r\n  Upborn with indefatigable wings\r\n  Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\r\n  The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\r\n  Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe\r\n  Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick\r\n  Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need\r\n  All circumspection, and we now no less\r\n  Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\r\n  The weight of all and our last hope relies.\r", "This said, he sat; and expectation held\r\n  His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd\r\n  To second, or oppose, or undertake\r\n  The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,\r\n  Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each\r\n  In others count'nance red his own dismay\r\n  Astonisht: none among the choice and prime\r\n  Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found\r\n  So hardie as to proffer or accept\r\n  Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last\r\n  SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd\r\n  Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride\r\n  Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake.\r", "O For that warning voice, which he who saw\r\n  Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud,\r\n  Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,\r\n  Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,\r\n  WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now,\r\n  While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd\r\n  The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd\r\n  Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now\r\n  SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,\r\n  The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,\r\n  To wreck on innocent frail man his loss\r\n  Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:\r\n  Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,\r\n  Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,\r\n  Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth\r\n  Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,\r\n  And like a devillish Engine back recoiles\r\n  Upon himself; horror and doubt distract\r\n  His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr\r\n  The Hell within him, for within him Hell\r\n  He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell\r\n  One step no more then from himself can fly\r\n  By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair\r\n  That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie\r\n  Of what he was, what is, and what must be\r\n  Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.\r\n  Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view\r\n  Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,\r\n  Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,\r\n  Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:\r\n  Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.\r", "O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,\r\n  Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God\r\n  Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs\r\n  Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,\r\n  But with no friendly voice, and add thy name\r\n  O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams\r\n  That bring to my remembrance from what state\r\n  I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;\r\n  Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down\r\n  Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:\r\n  Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return\r\n  From me, whom he created what I was\r\n  In that bright eminence, and with his good\r\n  Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.\r\n  What could be less then to afford him praise,\r\n  The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,\r\n  How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,\r\n  And wrought but malice; lifted up so high\r\n  I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher\r\n  Would set me highest, and in a moment quit\r\n  The debt immense of endless gratitude,\r\n  So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;\r\n  Forgetful what from him I still receivd,\r\n  And understood not that a grateful mind\r\n  By owing owes not, but still pays, at once\r\n  Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?\r\n  O had his powerful Destiny ordaind\r\n  Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood\r\n  Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd\r\n  Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power\r\n  As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean\r\n  Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great\r\n  Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within\r\n  Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.\r\n  Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?\r\n  Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,\r\n  But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?\r\n  Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,\r\n  To me alike, it deals eternal woe.\r\n  Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will\r\n  Chose freely what it now so justly rues.\r\n  Me miserable! which way shall I flie\r\n  Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?\r\n  Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;\r\n  And in the lowest deep a lower deep\r\n  Still threatning to devour me opens wide,\r\n  To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.\r\n  O then at last relent: is there no place\r\n  Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?\r\n  None left but by submission; and that word\r\n  DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame\r\n  Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd\r\n  With other promises and other vaunts\r\n  Then to submit, boasting I could subdue\r\n  Th' Omnipotent.

Or could we break our way\r\n  By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\r\n  With blackest Insurrection, to confound\r\n  Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie\r\n  All incorruptible would on his Throne\r\n  Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould\r\n  Incapable of stain would soon expel\r\n  Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire\r\n  Victorious.  Thus repuls'd, our final hope\r\n  Is flat despair: we must exasperate\r\n  Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\r\n  And that must end us, that must be our cure,\r\n  To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\r\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\n  Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,\r\n  To perish rather, swallowd up and lost\r\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\n  Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\r\n  Let this be good, whether our angry Foe\r\n  Can give it, or will ever? how he can\r\n  Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.\r\n  Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\r\n  Belike through impotence, or unaware,\r\n  To give his Enemies thir wish, and end\r\n  Them in his anger, whom his anger saves\r\n  To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\r\n  Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,\r\n  Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;\r\n  Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,\r\n  What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\r\n  Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\r\n  What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook\r\n  With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\r\n  The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd\r\n  A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\r\n  Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\r\n  What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires\r\n  Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage\r\n  And plunge us in the Flames? or from above\r\n  Should intermitted vengeance Arme again\r\n  His red right hand to plague us? what if all\r\n  Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament\r\n  Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\r\n  Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\r\n  One day upon our heads; while we perhaps\r\n  Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,\r\n  Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd\r\n  Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\r\n  Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\r\n  Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\r\n  There to converse with everlasting groans,\r\n  Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\r\n  Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.\r\n  Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike\r\n  My voice disswades; for what can force or guile\r\n  With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\r\n  Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth\r\n  All these our motions vain, sees and derides;\r\n  Not more Almighty to resist our might\r\n  Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\r\n  Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n\r\n  Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here\r\n  Chains & these Torments? better these then worse\r\n  By my advice; since fate inevitable\r\n  Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\r\n  The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\r\n  Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\r\n  That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,\r\n  If we were wise, against so great a foe\r\n  Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.\r\n  I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\r\n  And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\r\n  What yet they know must follow, to endure\r\n  Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\r\n  The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\r\n  Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\r\n  Our Supream Foe in time may much remit\r\n  His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd\r\n  Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd\r\n  With what is punish't; whence these raging fires\r\n  Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\r\n  Our purer essence then will overcome\r\n  Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,\r\n  Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd\r\n  In temper and in nature, will receive\r\n  Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\r\n  This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,\r\n  Besides what hope the never-ending flight\r\n  Of future days may bring, what chance, what change\r\n  Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers\r\n  For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\r\n  If we procure not to our selves more woe.\r", "Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb\r\n  Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,\r\n  Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.\r", "Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n\r\n  We warr, if warr be best, or to regain\r\n  Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then\r\n  May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild\r\n  To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:\r\n  The former vain to hope argues as vain\r\n  The latter: for what place can be for us\r\n  Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream\r\n  We overpower?  Suppose he should relent\r\n  And publish Grace to all, on promise made\r\n  Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we\r\n  Stand in his presence humble, and receive\r\n  Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne\r\n  With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\r\n  Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits\r\n  Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\r\n  Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\r\n  Our servile offerings.  This must be our task\r\n  In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom\r\n  Eternity so spent in worship paid\r\n  To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\r\n  By force impossible, by leave obtain'd\r\n  Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state\r\n  Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek\r\n  Our own good from our selves, and from our own\r\n  Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,\r\n  Free, and to none accountable, preferring\r\n  Hard liberty before the easie yoke\r\n  Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\r\n  Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,\r\n  Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\r\n  We can create, and in what place so e're\r\n  Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\r\n  Through labour and endurance.  This deep world\r\n  Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst\r\n  Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire\r\n  Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,\r\n  And with the Majesty of darkness round\r\n  Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\r\n  Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?\r\n  As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light\r\n  Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile\r\n  Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\r\n  Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise\r\n  Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?\r\n  Our torments also may in length of time\r\n  Become our Elements, these piercing Fires\r\n  As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd\r\n  Into their temper; which must needs remove\r\n  The sensible of pain.  All things invite\r\n  To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State\r\n  Of order, how in safety best we may\r\n  Compose our present evils, with regard\r\n  Of what we are and where, dismissing quite\r\n  All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.\r", "He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\r\n  Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\r\n  The sound of blustring winds, which all night long\r\n  Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\r\n  Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\r\n  Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\r\n  After the Tempest: Such applause was heard\r\n  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,\r\n  Advising peace: for such another Field\r\n  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\r\n  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL\r\n  Wrought still within them; and no less desire\r\n  To found this nether Empire, which might rise\r\n  By pollicy, and long process of time,\r\n  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.\r\n  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,\r\n  SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave\r\n  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd\r\n  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and publick care;\r\n  And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\r\n  Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood\r\n  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear\r\n  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\r\n  Drew audience and attention still as Night\r\n  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\r", "Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE,\r\n  And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd\r\n  Had it bin onely coveting to Eye\r\n  That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,\r\n  Much more to taste it under banne to touch.\r\n  But past who can recall, or don undoe?\r\n  Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so\r\n  Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact\r\n  Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,\r\n  Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first\r\n  Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;\r\n  Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,\r\n  Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man\r\n  Higher degree of Life, inducement strong\r\n  To us, as likely tasting to attaine\r\n  Proportional ascent, which cannot be\r\n  But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.\r\n  Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,\r\n  Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy\r\n  Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,\r\n  Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,\r\n  For us created, needs with us must faile,\r\n  Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,\r\n  Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,\r\n  Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power\r\n  Creation could repeate, yet would be loath\r\n  Us to abolish, least the Adversary\r\n  Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God\r\n  Most Favors, who can please him long?

Up he rode\r\n  Followd with acclamation and the sound\r\n  Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd\r\n  Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire\r\n  Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst)\r\n  The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,\r\n  The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,\r\n  While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.\r\n  Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,\r\n  Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in\r\n  The great Creator from his work returnd\r\n  Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;\r\n  Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne\r\n  To visit oft the dwellings of just Men\r\n  Delighted, and with frequent intercourse\r\n  Thither will send his winged Messengers\r\n  On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung\r\n  The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n,\r\n  That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led\r\n  To Gods Eternal house direct the way,\r\n  A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold\r\n  And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,\r\n  Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way\r\n  Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest\r\n  Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh\r\n  Eev'ning arose in EDEN, for the Sun\r\n  Was set, and twilight from the East came on,\r\n  Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount\r\n  Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne\r\n  Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,\r\n  The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down\r\n  With his great Father (for he also went\r\n  Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge\r\n  Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,\r\n  Author and end of all things, and from work\r\n  Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day,\r\n  As resting on that day from all his work,\r\n  But not in silence holy kept; the Harp\r\n  Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,\r\n  And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,\r\n  All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire\r\n  Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice\r\n  Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds\r\n  Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.\r\n  Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,\r\n  Great are thy works, JEHOVAH, infinite\r\n  Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue\r\n  Relate thee; greater now in thy return\r\n  Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day\r\n  Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create\r\n  Is greater then created to destroy.\r\n  Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound\r\n  Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt\r\n  Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine\r\n  Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought\r\n  Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw\r\n  The number of thy worshippers.

As new wak't from soundest sleep\r\n  Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid\r\n  In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun\r\n  Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.\r\n  Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,\r\n  And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd\r\n  By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,\r\n  As thitherward endevoring, and upright\r\n  Stood on my feet; about me round I saw\r\n  Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,\r\n  And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,\r\n  Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,\r\n  Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,\r\n  With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.\r\n  My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb\r\n  Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran\r\n  With supple joints, as lively vigour led:\r\n  But who I was, or where, or from what cause,\r\n  Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,\r\n  My Tongue obey'd and readily could name\r\n  What e're I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,\r\n  And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,\r\n  Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,\r\n  And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,\r\n  Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?\r\n  Not of my self; by some great Maker then,\r\n  In goodness and in power praeeminent;\r\n  Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,\r\n  From whom I have that thus I move and live,\r\n  And feel that I am happier then I know.\r\n  While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,\r\n  From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld\r\n  This happie Light, when answer none return'd,\r\n  On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours\r\n  Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep\r\n  First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd\r\n  My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought\r\n  I then was passing to my former state\r\n  Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:\r\n  When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,\r\n  Whose inward apparition gently mov'd\r\n  My Fancy to believe I yet had being,\r\n  And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,\r\n  And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise,\r\n  First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd\r\n  First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide\r\n  To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.\r\n  So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,\r\n  And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire\r\n  Smooth sliding without step, last led me up\r\n  A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,\r\n  A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees\r\n  Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw\r\n  Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree\r\n  Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye\r\n  Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite\r\n  To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found\r\n  Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream\r\n  Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun\r\n  My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide\r\n  Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,\r\n  Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw\r\n  In adoration at his feet I fell\r\n  Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,\r\n  Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest\r\n  Above, or round about thee or beneath.\r\n  This Paradise I give thee, count it thine\r\n  To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:\r\n  Of every Tree that in the Garden growes\r\n  Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:\r\n  But of the Tree whose operation brings\r\n  Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set\r\n  The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,\r\n  Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,\r\n  Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,\r\n  And shun the bitter consequence: for know,\r\n  The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command\r\n  Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;\r\n  From that day mortal, and this happie State\r\n  Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World\r\n  Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc'd\r\n  The rigid interdiction, which resounds\r\n  Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice\r\n  Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect\r\n  Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd.\r\n  Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth\r\n  To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords\r\n  Possess it, and all things that therein live,\r\n  Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.\r\n  In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold\r\n  After thir kindes; I bring them to receave\r\n  From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie\r\n  With low subjection; understand the same\r\n  Of Fish within thir watry residence,\r\n  Not hither summond, since they cannot change\r\n  Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.\r\n  As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold\r\n  Approaching two and two, These cowring low\r\n  With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing.\r\n  I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood\r\n  Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd\r\n  My sudden apprehension: but in these\r\n  I found not what me thought I wanted still;\r\n  And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd.\r", "O by what Name, for thou above all these,\r\n  Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,\r\n  Surpassest farr my naming, how may I\r\n  Adore thee, Author of this Universe,\r\n  And all this good to man, for whose well being\r\n  So amply, and with hands so liberal\r\n  Thou hast provided all things: but with mee\r\n  I see not who partakes.  In solitude\r\n  What happiness, who can enjoy alone,\r\n  Or all enjoying, what contentment find?\r\n  Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,\r\n  As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd.\r", "What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth\r\n  With various living creatures, and the Aire\r\n  Replenisht, and all these at thy command\r\n  To come and play before thee, know'st thou not\r\n  Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,\r\n  And reason not contemptibly; with these\r\n  Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.\r\n  So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd\r\n  So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor'd,\r\n  And humble deprecation thus repli'd.\r", "Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power,\r\n  My Maker, be propitious while I speak.\r\n  Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,\r\n  And these inferiour farr beneath me set?\r\n  Among unequals what societie\r\n  Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?\r\n  Which must be mutual, in proportion due\r\n  Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie\r\n  The one intense, the other still remiss\r\n  Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove\r\n  Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak\r\n  Such as I seek, fit to participate\r\n  All rational delight, wherein the brute\r\n  Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce\r\n  Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;\r\n  So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;\r\n  Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle\r\n  So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;\r\n  Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.\r", "O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\r\n  Of utmost hope! now clear I understand\r\n  What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\r\n  Why our great expectation should be call'd\r\n  The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\r\n  High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes\r\n  Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\r\n  Of God most High; So God with man unites.\r\n  Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise\r\n  Expect with mortal paine: say where and when\r\n  Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\r", "To whom thus MICHAEL.

Yet least they faint\r\n  At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,\r\n  For I behold them soft'nd and with tears\r\n  Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\r\n  If patiently thy bidding they obey,\r\n  Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\r\n  To ADAM what shall come in future dayes,\r\n  As I shall thee enlighten, intermix\r\n  My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;\r\n  So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\r\n  And on the East side of the Garden place,\r\n  Where entrance up from EDEN easiest climbes,\r\n  Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\r\n  Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\r\n  And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\r\n  Least Paradise a receptacle prove\r\n  To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\r\n  With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.\r", "He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd\r\n  For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\r\n  Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each\r\n  Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape\r\n  Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those\r\n  Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze,\r\n  Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\r\n  Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile\r\n  To resalute the World with sacred Light\r\n  LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd\r\n  The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE\r\n  Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,\r\n  Strength added from above, new hope to spring\r\n  Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\r\n  Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd.\r", "EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all\r\n  The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends\r\n  But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n\r\n  So prevalent as to concerne the mind\r\n  Of God high blest, or to incline his will,\r\n  Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\r\n  Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\r\n  Ev'n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught\r\n  By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,\r\n  Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,\r\n  Methought I saw him placable and mild,\r\n  Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew\r\n  That I was heard with favour; peace returnd\r\n  Home to my brest, and to my memorie\r\n  His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\r\n  Which then not minded in dismay, yet now\r\n  Assures me that the bitterness of death\r\n  Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,\r\n  EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,\r\n  Mother of all things living, since by thee\r\n  Man is to live, and all things live for Man.\r", "To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.\r\n  Ill worthie I such title should belong\r\n  To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\r\n  A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\r\n  Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\r\n  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,\r\n  That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\r\n  The sourse of life; next favourable thou,\r\n  Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,\r\n  Farr other name deserving.  But the Field\r\n  To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\r\n  Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\r\n  All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\r\n  Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\r\n  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,\r\n  Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\r\n  Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\r\n  What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\r\n  Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\r"]
